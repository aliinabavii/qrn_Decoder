# qrn_Decoder

The QRN Decoder is a specialized tool designed to recover .qrn files that have been quarantined by antivirus software. Antivirus programs often isolate files they deem suspicious, which can sometimes include legitimate files essential for users. This decoder allows users to extract and restore the contents of these .qrn files, enabling access to potentially important data that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

With a straightforward command-line interface, the QRN Decoder is easy to use and compatible across multiple platforms, making it a handy tool for anyone who frequently deals with issues related to quarantined files.
